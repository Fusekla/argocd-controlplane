# Migration Notes

## Current State
As `ArgoCD` was not running any apps, it was uninstalled and reinstall from scratch from this repository.

## Target State
- Managed via GitOps in this repository
- Pinned Argo CD version: v2.14.6
- Bootstrap path: `clusters/local/bootstrap/`

## Differences Identified
- [ ] Namespace definition differences  
- [ ] Service type (ClusterIP/LoadBalancer/NodePort)  
- [ ] Ingress/Route config  
- [ ] RBAC / argocd-cm tweaks  
- [ ] Any custom health checks or exclusions

## Migration Plan
1. Vendor manifests into repo (done).
2. Render and diff against live cluster:
  ```bash
  kustomize build clusters/local/bootstrap | kubectl diff -f -
  ```
3. Label all Git-tracked resources with app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=gitops.
4. Apply manifests with prune disabled.
5. Once aligned, introduce root Application in clusters/local/root/.
6. Enable automated sync + prune only when safe.

## Known Risks / TODOs

- Initial labels mutated selectors â†’ immutable-field error
  **Resolution** : Set `includeSelectors:` false (or removed labels) for bootstrap to avoid selector changes.
